Using Segment Tree. For each tree node, it has range(a list contains left and right), sum, left subtree and right subtree. The range of the left subtree is [left, mid]. The range of the right subtree is [mid + 1, right]

Time Complexity:
    Update: O(logN)
    Query: O(logN)

Space Complexity: O(N)
