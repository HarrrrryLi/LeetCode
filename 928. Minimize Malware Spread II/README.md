DFS.

For each initial, do DFS, mark each visited node as infected by this initial node. Then calculate for each initial, how many nodes will be only infected by this initial.

Notice when we do DFS, we can't pass any other initials, in other words, we regard any other initials as walls.

Time Complexity O(N * L). Space Complexity O(N * L). N how many nodes it contains. L is the lenght of initial.
